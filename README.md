## Snapshots

Every 6 months we [publish snapshots](https://github.com/nyaruka/rapidpro/discussions) for other deployments,
which are essentially a set of stable versions of the components that make up the platform. To upgrade from
one snapshot to the next, you must first install and run the migrations for the latest snapshot you are on,
then every snapshot afterwards.
