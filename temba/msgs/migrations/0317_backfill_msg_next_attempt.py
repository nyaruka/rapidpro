# next_attempt is now only set on an outgoing message whilst it's awaiting a retry - courier clears it when a message
# moves on to wired, sent, delivered, read or failed - but until now it was left as it was, so a message which errored
# and was then sent still carries the time of the retry it no longer needs. The retry index added in 0316 is on
# next_attempt being set, so those rows would sit in it for no reason. This clears them.
#
# The rows are found through that index rather than by walking the table - it's exactly the set of rows the index
# holds, minus the ones legitimately awaiting a retry - so each batch is an index scan rather than a slice of the
# table. The status check is repeated on the update itself so that a message which errors again between being
# selected and being updated keeps the retry it was just given. Each batch is its own transaction, and the loop runs
# until nothing is left, so an interrupted run just picks up where it left off.
