# Msg.folder is denormalized from direction/visibility/status/flow and is written by mailroom and courier for new
# messages - this fills it in for the messages that predate that. The CASE mirrors Msg.derive_folder, including its
# precedence: being deleted, and then being unhandled, both come before the user facing folders, so that a message
# which is archived or deleted whilst still pending doesn't land in Archived.
#
# A message whose state matches no branch keeps its null folder rather than being guessed at. The temba_msg_on_change
# trigger rules out most of those - an incoming message that isn't pending or handled, and an outgoing message that is
# archived - but not every one: an outgoing message that is somehow pending or handled is legal and falls through.
#
# The table is far too large to scan for null folders, so we walk the primary key range in batches instead, newest
# first so that the messages users are most likely to be looking at are filled in first. Each batch is its own
# transaction, so an interrupted run can be resumed from the last id it reported.
#
# Batching by id range is what gets each statement served by the primary key, but the size is chosen by what one
# statement should cost rather than by that. msgs_msg carries a FOR EACH ROW trigger, so a batch is that many plpgsql
# calls, that many row locks held until it commits, and a WAL burst to match - all on the rows courier and mailroom
# are concurrently writing. It also carries a FOR EACH STATEMENT update trigger with OLD and NEW transition tables, so
# every batch materializes two tuplestores of whole msgs_msg rows, message text included, and joins them five times
# over - the part that grows worst with batch size, since past work_mem those tuplestores spill to disk. Hence a size
# that keeps a batch cheap on the dense recent end of the table, where ids and rows are close to one to one.

BATCH_SIZE = 10_000  # ids per batch, not rows - ids are sparse wherever messages have been deleted
